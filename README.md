- 👋 Hi, I’m @chguide
- 👀 I’m interested in GIS and Python - but wanting to get familiar with more languages.  I'm a GIS Specialist, spending most of my time in ESRI software or Python wher I use the arcpy module.  I'm not really sure what GitHub will become for me...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what I call more general Python.  I've done quite a bit with arcpy and am skilled, but I'm really wanting to expand my skillset.  After I've done some expanding, I'll likely start with Java next.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really!
- 📫 How to reach me chrisharlow6@gmail.com or chrisharlowportfolio.weebly.com
