- 👋 Hi, I’m @chguide
- 👀 I’m interested in GIS and Python.  This is mainly a place I'll use to store projects and code that I'm just working through on my personal time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what I call more general Python.  I've done quite a bit with arcpy and am quite skilled, but I'm really wanting to expand my skillset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really!
